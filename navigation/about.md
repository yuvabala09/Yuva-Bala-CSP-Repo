Hello I am Yuva Bala and I am 15 and a half years old and I go to Del Norte High School. My passion right now is to elevate my understanding in these following feilds: Buisness, Economy, Finance, and Computer Science. I love to play tennis 🎾, soccer ⚽, shadowbox 🥊 and swim 🏊 in my pool during my free time as well as hang out with my friends. I enjoy playing a couple of video games like Fifa and Fortnite. I love to try new foods 🥘 as well because I like eating food and I would say my favorite cuisine would be either Indian 🇮🇳 or Mexican 🇲🇽. Me and my family travel once or twice a year and I love to experience other country's culture as well as their food. This year my goals are to get straight A's in school just like last year and I also would like to go far in my important clubs like DECA and FPS. Python and CS have intrigued me since last year so I took this course to get a feel for it and I am also taking Python lessons outside of school.
