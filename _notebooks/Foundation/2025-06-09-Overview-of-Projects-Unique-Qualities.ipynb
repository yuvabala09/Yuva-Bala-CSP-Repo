    "### Variables\n",
    "- Think of a variable as a labeled box that holds information. Instead of hard‑coding the value everywhere, you just refer to the box’s name and read or update whatever’s inside.\n",
    "Variables are essential for storing dynamic data that can change during the execution of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Abstraction\n",
    "- This is the art of hiding messy details and exposing only what you need. You treat a complicated data structure through a simple, high‑level interface, so you can use it without worrying about its inner workings.\n",
    "It helps programmers manage complexity and build scalable systems more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Expressions\n",
    "- An arithmetic recipe made of numbers, variable names, and operators (+, –, *, / …). When the program evaluates the recipe, it returns a single numeric answer you can use for further work.\n",
    "These expressions are commonly used in everything from calculating totals to controlling loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings\n",
    "- A string is text—any sequence of characters such as letters, digits, or punctuation—stored as one value. Programs use strings to keep and manipulate words, sentences, or whole blocks of text.\n",
    "Strings are often used for user input, displaying messages, or processing textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Booleans\n",
    "- A boolean is a two‑state value: true or false. Programs rely on these yes/no flags to decide what path to follow or which action to take. They're critical for conditionals and loops that require decision-making logic."
