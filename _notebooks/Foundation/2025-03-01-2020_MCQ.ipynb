    "I finished the 2020 MCQ Practice Exam 1 in around 2.5 hours. I saw myself going over the question many times in order to understand the question fully and answer it to my best abilities. I took a couple breaks in between the test and sometimes I would get burned out and had to stop the test all together. I still persevered however and was able to get a respectable 57/67. Whenever I came across a problem that I deemed very challenging for me, I made sure to mark it down and come back to it in later times. \n",

    "![Comparing MCQ 1 to MCQ 2](/yuvabalacsprepo/images/2020MCQEXAMCSP.png)\n",
    "I got a 55/66 on MCQ 1 and a 57/67 on MCQ 2. Thought it was relatively small, I made improvement in the end by getting 2 questions more correct. This time, I took more time however because I again saw myself reading over  a question many different times to understand it. Even though I took the MCQ almost 3 months ago, I was still able to remember certain problems from the past MCQ and get the correct answers. For example, I remembered that a program runs in a reasonable amount of time when it is in a polynomial (represented by a polynomial). I also learned how to read binary sometime over the past 3 months which helped me get the correct answer to the question asking to represent colors on the rbg scale with binary. Overall, learning these skills from the past helped me get a better grade and fortify my understanding over other topics.\n",

    "### **Question 10: Science Museum Tickets**\n",
    "![Question 10](/yuvabalacsprepo/images/2020MCQEXAMQ10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Thought Process:** I misinterpreted how the program structured ticket pricing logic. The correct approach properly separates conditions for age groups and guided tour selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer Explanation:** The correct answer uses a structured conditional check:\n",
    "- If `age >= 13`, base cost = $8, else base cost = $6.\n",
    "- If `includesTour == True`, the additional fee is added.\n",
    "- This ensures all conditions are properly evaluated without ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer B\n",
    "Correct. This code segment initially sets cost to 6 (the cheapest possible ticket price), then increases cost by 2 for people whose age is greater than 12. Regardless of the person’s age, cost is increased by 2 for people going on a guided tour.\n",

    "![Question 25](/yuvabalacsprepo/images/2020MCQEXAMQ25.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Thought Process:** I incorrectly assumed the Internet is centrally monitored when it is actually decentralized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer Explanation:**\n",
    "- Data is dynamically routed through multiple paths for reliability.\n",
    "- Standardized protocols allow seamless communication between devices.\n",
    "- The Internet does not rely on a single monitoring entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer C\n",
    "Correct. Statement I is false. The Internet is not controlled from a central device. Statements II and III are true. The Internet uses redundant routing to support fault tolerance. The Internet uses protocols so that data is transmitted in a standard format.\n",

    "![Question 26](/yuvabalacsprepo/images/2020MCQEXAMQ26.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Thought Process:** I mistakenly believed timestamps were not metadata when they actually fall under descriptive metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer Explanation:**\n",
    "- Metadata includes timestamps, file format, and author information.\n",
    "- This helps in organization, copyright management, and searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer D\n",
    "Correct. Metadata typically consists of descriptive information about the data, not a copy of the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question 40: Role of Certificate Authorities**\n",
    "![Question 40](/yuvabalacsprepo/images/2020MCQEXAMQ40.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Thought Process:** I confused DNS functions with Certificate Authorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer Explanation:**\n",
    "- DNS translates domain names to IPs.\n",
    "- Certificate Authorities verify website identities and issue digital certificates.\n",
    "- This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring trust in HTTPS encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer D\n",
    "Correct. Certificate authorities are entities that issue digital certificates, which are used to certify the ownership of public keys.\n",

    "### **Question 51: Creative Commons**\n",
    "![Question 51](/yuvabalacsprepo/images/2020MCQEXAMQ51.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Thought Process:** I assumed CC licenses apply universally, but they only apply if explicitly chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer Explanation:**\n",
    "- Creative Commons allows creators to define usage permissions.\n",
    "- Works not under CC are still protected by copyright law.\n",
    "- Users must follow the specific terms of each CC license.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer A\n",
    "Correct. Creative Commons licensing allows copyright owners to specify the ways in which their works can be used or distributed. This allows individuals to access or modify these works without the risk of violating copyright laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **Question 57: Purpose of Internet Protocols**\n",
    "![Question 57](/yuvabalacsprepo/images/2020MCQEXAMQ57.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "***My Thought Process:** I mistakenly thought TCP/IP handled encryption when it only manages data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer Explanation:**\n",
    "- TCP ensures reliable, ordered data transmission.\n",
    "- IP provides addressing and routing between devices.\n",
    "- Encryption validation is handled by Certificate Authorities, not TCP/IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer C\n",
    "Correct. Protocols for Internet communication, such as TCP/IP, are intended to define a standard format for messages sent between devices on the Internet.\n",

    "### **Question 62: Selection Statements Display True**\n",
    "![Question 62](/yuvabalacsprepo/images/2020MCQEXAMQ62.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Thought Process:*** I misunderstood Boolean logic in conditional execution and did not read the question fully and choose TWO answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer Explanation:**\n",
    "- `if (x OR y)` executes if at least one condition is `True`.\n",
    "- Since `x = True`, the statement executes regardless of `y`'s value.\n",
    "- The OR condition ensures flexibility in logical decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer A\n",
    "Correct. Since x is true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since x OR y evaluates to true, true is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer B\n",
    "Correct. Since x OR y evaluates to true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since x is true, true is displayed.\n",

    "\n",
    "**My Thought Process:** I did not choose a second answer due to not reading the question fully, but I did get one of the answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer Explanation:**\n",
    "- Extract `\"jack\"` using `Substring(\"jackrabbit\", 1, 4)`.\n",
    "- Concatenate `\"jack\"` with `\"a\"` to form `\"jacka\"`.\n",
    "- Extract `\"lope\"` using `Substring(\"antelope\", 5, 4)`.\n",
    "- Concatenate `\"jacka\"` with `\"lope\"` to form `\"jackalope\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer B\n",
    "Correct. This code segment stores the substring \"lope\" in animal. It then concatenates \"a\" and \"lope\", storing the result \"alope\" in animal. Lastly, it concatenates the substring \"jack\" and \"alope\", storing the result \"jackalope\" in animal.\n",

    "![Question 66](/yuvabalacsprepo/images/2020MCQEXAMQ66.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Thought Process:** I was honestly lost on this question and could not figure out what the right order would look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer Explanation:**\n",
    "- `count` should only increment when `IsPerfect(currentNum)` is `True`.\n",
    "- Removing unnecessary increments prevents duplicate counting.\n",
    "- Ensuring correct placement of `count++` maintains logical flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer A\n",
    "Correct. This line should be removed. The variable count should increase by 1 when currentNum is a perfect number, so it should only be incremented in the body of the IF statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer C\n",
    "Correct. This line should be removed. Every integer from start to end should be checked, so currentNum should only be incremented inside the loop but outside the body of the IF statement.\n",

    "### **Question 67: Error in NumOccurrences Procedure**\n",
    "![Question 67](/yuvabalacsprepo/images/2020MCQEXAMQ67.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**My Thought Process:** I misdiagnosed why the function always returned `0`. I also did not understand the procedure of this fucntion. I need to work on understanding the count <-- count + 1 line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct Answer Explanation:**\n",
    "- The issue was resetting `count = 0` inside the loop.\n",
    "- Instead, `count` should be initialized once before iterating.\n",
    "- This allows it to accumulate occurrences correctly instead of resetting every iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer A\n",
    "Correct. For this code segment, count is increased to 1 the first time \"birch\" is encountered in the list. However, count is reset to 0 when the code segment moves to the next list element. The last time \"birch\" is encountered in the list, count is again increased to 1, causing the procedure to return 1 instead of the intended result 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer B\n",
    "Correct. For this code segment, count is increased to 1 the first time \"maple\" is encountered in the list. However, count is reset to 0 when the code segment moves to the next list element. This causes the procedure to return 0 instead of the intended result 1.\n",
