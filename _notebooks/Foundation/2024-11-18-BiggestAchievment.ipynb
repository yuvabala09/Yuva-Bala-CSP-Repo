For example, you can use an app on your phone to control a ROOMBA cleaning device in your house. In our case with our website, the user presses a button with an argument written out under the name in which they logged in, which calls the API to save the information in the backend and also retrieve other users' arguments. \n",

    "When we started the project, we had no idea what we wanted to choose. We thought of many different ideas but finally, we took inspiration from reddit and it's many creative subreddits. We the discussed with classmates to choose our offical class period topic which was \"Vote for the GOAT\". Our period had a bar at the top of the site to switch between each groups topics. \n",

    "## Group Ideas and Site: Internet Debates\n",
    "We personally had the idea to give users prompts and have them pick a side to represent their choice. Then, they would submit an argument to support their choice which would flow down below the user prompt. Users would be able to see other people's responses to get an idea of each person's unique choice and reason. If the user liked it or disliked it, they could show this by upvoting or downvoting. There is also a sidebar that has various topics the user could choose to respond on. Other features of our site were added along the way such as a popup that displays the moderator rules so that users can maintain a friendly social media zone. Lastly, people can exit the webiste and come back to still see their original arguments as well as other peoples."
