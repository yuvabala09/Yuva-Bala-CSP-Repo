    "## Executive Summary \n",
    "- Created a database to store information regarding countries national dishes, and a description for each dish.\n",
    "- REST api with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE functions that allow users to interact with the page in the intended way.\n",
    "- Created the frontend for the national country generator, with a form for users to fill out to add more countries to the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Team Website Purpose\n",
    "- Food cuisine social platform for users to discover and learn about different cuisines and their respective dishes in five different dietary categories. The website will be a social media zone for users to share their favorite dishes as well, and interact with other users and use Artificial Intelegence to get even more reccomendations and recipes and ingredients as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Individual Feature\n",
    "- The purpose of my individual feature is to allow users to discover national dishes of any country they want, and also add their own post for a country that is either not on the list, or a regional dish that they want users to see. The user can also edit and delete their posts if needed. "

The POST request is seen when the user creates a post and fills out the information for (country, dish, and description) and submits the post. The PUT requets is made when the user selects a post and changes the information for at least one of the fields. Lastly, the DELETE request is made when the user wants to delete any of the posts."

    "- Frontend: I have designed a dynamic interface for users to discover and add to a country national dish generator.\n",
    "- Backend: I developed a RESTful API with CRUD operations and integrated it with a databse holding information for (country, dish, description)\n",
    "- Testing: I have used POSTMAN to test my API endpoints for each function in my feature. POSTMAN has allowed me to debug my code and figure out where exactly I had problems that resulted in a 404, 405, or 500 error. POSTMAN can assure me if my backend code is accurate or not so I can update the backend or frontend accordingly.\n",
    "- Improvments: This sprint has enabled me to improve my skills for frontend and backend and understand how simple and complex APIs work. I have also learned how to use POSTMAN to test my API endpoints. I do however need to improve my skills in testing and debugging my code. But overall I have learned a lot from this sprint and I am excited to continue working on this project and future sprints. "
