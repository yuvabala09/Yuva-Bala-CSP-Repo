    "The two main topics me and my group taught in 3.5 Booleans were relational operators and logical operators. They were very simple commands that I was able to research and learn about to succesfully teach to my classmates. The topic that was assigned to me was Logical Operators which were three boolean functions named NOT, AND, and OR. These three boolean functions were very easy to understand so I tried to personalize it as much as I could to make it more memorable and create real world examples people could connect to. I also created examples in both python and javascript where I used the three boolean functions that were based off of the real world examples."

    "Variables: A variable serves as a container for storing data, allowing programmers to reference and manipulate the data by using the variable's name instead of its actual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Abstraction: Data abstraction simplifies complex data structures by highlighting only the essential details and hiding others. This enables programmers to handle data more efficiently without needing to worry about the underlying processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical Expressions: Mathematical expressions consist of numbers, variables, and operators (such as +, -, *, or /) that are evaluated to produce a result. In programming, these expressions are essential for performing calculations and manipulating numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings: A string is a series of characters that represent text in programming. It can include letters, numbers, and symbols, and is typically used to handle text-based data, such as words, sentences, or entire paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans: Booleans are data types that can hold one of two values: true or false. In programming, boolean values help control the flow of a program by determining the outcome of conditions or expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditionals: Conditionals are programming constructs that make decisions based on whether a specific condition is true or false. If true, a particular block of code runs; if false, an alternative block may execute or be skipped altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested Conditionals: Nested conditionals involve placing one conditional statement within another, enabling more complex decision-making. The program first evaluates the outer condition, and if it holds true, proceeds to assess the inner condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration: Iteration refers to the repeated execution of a block of code, usually through loops. Loops allow a program to repeat a set of instructions a certain number of times or until a specific condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists: A list is a data structure that stores multiple items in one variable. Lists can hold various types of data, such as numbers, strings, or even other lists, enabling programmers to organize and work with collections of data more easily."
